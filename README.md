# tgm - Time-gating method with automatic calibration

The repository contains source codes, antenna designs, as well as EM simulation data and measurements (perfomred in anechoic chamber and in non-anechoic environment) prepared for the research paper entitled: 

_Accurate Non-Anechoic Radiation Pattern Measurements of Small Antennas Using Time-Gating Method With Automatic Calibration_

Three examples are considered:
1. Calibration of a Vivaldi antenna against EM simulation results at two selected frequencies followed by re-use of the obtained calibration data for correction of the non-anechoic measurements at different frequencies. The obtained resuls are validated against measurements from the anechoic chamber.
2. Calibration of a compact monopole antenna w.r.t. EM simulations and re-use of the obtained calibration data for correction of non-anechoic measurements at different set of frequencies. The obtained results are compared with EM simulation data.
3. Calibration of the compact monopole antenna (referred to as antenna 1) w.r.t. measurements performed in anechoic chamber and re-use of the obtained calibration data for correction of the non-anechoic measurements of another radiator (antenna 2) of similar size at different operating frequencies. The results obtained for the antenna 2 are compared with EM simulation data.
